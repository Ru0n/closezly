# Closezly Implementation Status

This document provides an overview of the current implementation status of the Closezly project, highlighting what has been completed, what is in progress, and what is planned for future development.

## Completed Components

### 1. Supabase Local Development Setup âœ…

- **Database Configuration**: Supabase local development environment is set up and running
- **pgvector Extension**: Installed and configured for RAG functionality
- **Database Schema**: Created tables for users, profiles, call transcripts, summaries, and document chunks
- **Row Level Security**: Implemented RLS policies for data security
- **Sample Data**: Seeded the database with sample data for testing

### 2. Desktop App (Electron) Setup âœ…

- **Main Process Architecture**:
  - AppState.ts: Singleton for managing global app state
  - WindowHelper.ts: For managing the overlay window
  - ShortcutsHelper.ts: For global keyboard shortcuts
  - ScreenshotHelper.ts: For screen capture functionality
  - ipcHandlers.ts: For IPC communication

- **Renderer Process**:
  - React-based UI for the overlay
  - TypeScript interfaces for type safety
  - CSS styling for the overlay UI
  - Event handling for user interactions

- **IPC Communication**:
  - Defined a clear IPC contract
  - Implemented handlers for all required IPC events
  - Exposed a limited API to the renderer process via contextBridge

- **Configuration Files**:
  - Updated package.json with required dependencies
  - Added vite.config.ts for the renderer process
  - Created forge.config.js for Electron Forge
  - Added HTML template for the renderer

- **Core Functionality**:
  - Window management (creation, visibility, positioning)
  - Global shortcuts for key actions
  - Screenshot capture for AI processing
  - State management for the application

## Next Steps

1. Complete the backend services implementation
2. Develop the web portal UI
3. Implement the RAG service
4. Add authentication flow
5. Connect desktop app to backend services
6. Implement CRM integrations
7. Set up automated testing
8. Configure deployment pipelines

## Known Issues

1. Desktop app image optimization not implemented in main process
2. Electron forge packaging not fully tested
3. Supabase migrations need refinement for production use

## Conclusion

The Closezly project has made significant progress with the completion of the Supabase setup and the desktop app implementation. The focus now shifts to developing the backend services and web portal, followed by the implementation of the RAG service and CRM integrations.
